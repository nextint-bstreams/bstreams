The exercise of the data subject's rights is free of charge. Where requests from a data subject are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character, We may either charge a reasonable fee taking into account the administrative costs of providing the information or communication or taking the action requested or refuse to act on request. Under the GDPR, data subjects have the following rights:

1. The right to obtain from Data Controller confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning him/her are being processed.
2. The right to access personal data.
3. The right to have personal data rectified if any of his/her personal data held by the data controller is inaccurate or the right to have incomplete personal data completed, including by means of providing a supplementary statement.
4. The right to be forgotten, including to delete the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed or because the data subject withdraws consent on which the processing is based.
5. The right to restrict the processing of personal data according to article 18 of GDPR.
6. The right to object to the Data Controller using personal data for a particular purpose or purposes.
7. The right to data portability. This means that, if data subjects have provided personal data to Data Controller directly, the latter is using it with his/her consent or for the performance of a contract, and that data is processed using automated means, data subject can ask Data Controller for a copy of that personal data to re-use with another service or business in many cases.
8. Rights relating to automated decision-making and profiling.
9. Right to file a complaint with a supervisory authority.

#### How do you enforce your rights? 
Data subjects can enforce their rights at any time by sending an e-mail to the following address: <hello@bstreams.io>
We have a duty to respond to requests at the latest within one month of receiving them. This deadline may be extended by two additional months if necessary, considering the complexity and the number of requests received. In case of extension data subjects will be informed of the delay and the reasons. If we do not take action on your request, we will inform them without delay and at the latest within one month of receipt of their request of the reasons for not taking action and on the possibility of filing a complaint with a supervisory authority and seeking a judicial remedy.
