We will store or transfer personal data within the European Economic Area, however some of our external providers may transfer and store personal data to a third party based in the United States. Transfer to a third country outside of the European Union may only happen as  long as the data recipient has entered into a data processing agreement implementing the Standard Contractual Clauses for the transfer of personal data to data processors established in third countries adopted by the European Commission decision (C(2010)593) of 5 February 2010 and as long as the recipient can guarantee an adequate level of protection similar to that applicable in the European Economic Area.
