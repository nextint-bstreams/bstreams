Data storage may vary depending on the purpose of processing. Unless otherwise required by mandatory law, all data collected for contractual purposes will be kept only for the time strictly necessary to perform our services and thereafter deleted.
Personal data related to your purchasing order may be stored, to the extent strictly necessary, for a longer period following specific regulatory obligations, including for the fulfillment of tax and accounting obligations. This period equals to 10 years.
When processing subject to your consent, we will keep the data until the user objects to such processing and withdraw consent.
